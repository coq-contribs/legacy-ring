It was the second version of the ring tactic after an initial version by Samuel Boutin.

From 2006 to 2012, it was kept in Coq archive in parallel with Bruno Barras, Benjamin Gr√©goire and Assia Mahboubi's third version of the ring tactic.

From 2012, it is part of the "coq-contribs" archive of Coq contributions.

It was stopped being ported to new version of Coq by its maintainers in 2017. Last compatibility is with Coq version 8.6.0.
